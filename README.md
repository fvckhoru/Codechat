# Codechat
OperSource Chat &amp; Coding In-Sync


# Description
Codechat was born as a free software, a convenient tool for neo-programmers and small work groups.
The goal of codechat is to make the exchange of material and opinions between programmers faster and smoother.

Okay, but what does codechat have to do?

Our idea is to connect a text editor to a chat room that gives the possibility to write code and to be displayed in sync by all participants in the chat. This will make batch scripting much faster and smoother.

Other interesting elements of Codechat are the *Dashboard* and the *Community* section. The Dashboard works like most social networks, a simple window where you can view everything your friends or colleagues post. Communities are groups created by users where it is possible to subscribe and receive news from the contents of this group

Objective:
At the moment Codechat is an idea, we want to develop this program to create a welcoming and practical place for all programmers who want to get in touch with other people who cultivate this passion, providing powerful tools that can facilitate the work and study of the code .
